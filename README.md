Part 1 :
This defines a Hospital class with a main method that creates and prints several objects of HospitalEmployee, Doctor, Nurse, and Surgeon classes. These classes inherit from HospitalEmployee class, which has a name and number attributes, and a work() method to print a message about the employee's work. The Doctor, Nurse, and Surgeon classes have additional attributes (specialty, numOfPatients, and operating) and modified work() methods that print specific messages for their roles. The main method creates and prints several objects of these classes, and invokes their work() methods to print the relevant messages.
